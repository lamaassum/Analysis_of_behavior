1,extra clothes good idea I think - could wear them.,1434359691988

2,Q3  I thought the pistol,1434622985254
2,Q4 no butter,1434623022955
2,"never thought about using it to keep warm, so yes then",1434623047266
2,5 yes to newspapers as they could use them to help light fires or to lie on on the ground,1434623082521
2,yes to the lighter,1434623098676
2,yes I think so,1434623120264
2,I will let you make the suggestions about each question,1434623149156
2,agree,1434623156688
2,yes,1434623184791
2,could be useful if they encounter wet weather,1434623308164
2,agreed,1434623331091
2,agreed,1434623364218
2,you missed the map,1434623395116
2,OK leave the map,1434623465676
2,and the whisky,1434623476768
2,"No 9 on my list is map, No 10 is whisky  No 11 is compass and No 12 chocolate",1434623551822
2,yes,1434623561685
2,well if they are no going far then yes but it could be useful in case they lose their way,1434623626347
2,agreed,1434623697474
2,"agree, it would also help boost sugar levels to keep them going",1434623826666
2,"agreed, just glad I am not one of them!",1434623920562
2,lol,1434623962643
2,bye,1434623996146
3,Yep,1435051750705
3,OK,1435051902848
3,Take it or leave it?,1435051918911
3,Apparently it's very good for lighting fires from a spark.  Might be useful if it's -40,1435051962447
3,So I said yes.,1435051978255
3,"Yes, it could be used with the lighter, even with no lighter fluid.",1435052023823
3,"OK, let's go for yes then.",1435052054495
3,"Agreed, let's go for yes.",1435052130030
3,"True, and you could also kill yourself if you don't want to freeze to death.  So yes to that.",1435052247566
3,:-),1435052251982
3,"I said yes, but only because it has some calories.  Walking 20miles would be tough with nothing to eat.",1435052417645
3,Maybe leave the butter and take the chocolate.,1435052434925
3,"Okay, let's leave the butter and take the chocolate.",1435052542428
3,"Also, there's no tin opener.",1435052554412
3,i said yes to the newspapers - handy for fires.,1435052655996
3,Lighting a fire without paper is a bit of a nightmare.  Good for bogroll too.,1435052717675
3,OK,1435052781355
3,I think we've agreed to take the lighter already,1435052804507
3,"Yes, you need a spark to light steel woo.",1435052821403
3,"Flints will do it, but you'd need to find them first.",1435052840555
3,OK,1435052905722
3,"Agreed, so yes to that one.",1435052938634
3,"I wasn't sure.  It's heavy to carry, though useful.  However, you could make a good bivouac with branches.",1435053070489
3,So let's say no to that one.,1435053081001
3,"I wasn't sure about the air map. What's the scale, etc. DOn;t know if it'd be useful",1435053196013
3,"And it's plastic, so it could be useful, so let's take it.",1435053251208
3,Indeed. It's also not good to drink alcohol in the low temperatures.  Best left behind.,1435053381400
3,Compass.  Definitely.,1435053409320
3,"Yes, let's take it.",1435053431448

3,"Well they're mostly small, except for the canvas and that's been left behind.",1435053510423
3,"Oh well, they've got the gun :-)",1435053534759
