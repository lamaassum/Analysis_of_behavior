1,ok! lets get started. do we need the steel wool?,1434358879100
1,I think I put that we shouldnt take it as I cant think what survival uses it might have,1434358938876
1,its not for fire lighting and isnt help against the weather,1434358949162
1,shall we put no then?,1434358953997
1,ok,1434358973476
1,"so agreed no on that one, yes.",1434358990403
1,onto the axe,1434359002345
1,"yes, i think it would be necessary to get fire wood",1434359068204
1,and its only xmall so not too heavy,1434359073553
1,so agreed yes,1434359079324
1,ok good,1434359109572
1,now the pistol,1434359116902
1,i think it would be necessary to scare away any bears,1434359151680
1,there are a lot of bears in northern canada!,1434359171421
1,"and again, a pistol is nt that heavy.",1434359182257
1,shall we say yes?,1434359185155
1,i think i would feel we needed it on the chance we met a bear,1434359254405
1,otherwise how would we scare them off?,1434359263364
1,"ok then, thats a yes.",1434359327815
1,what were your thoughts on the butter?,1434359342766
1,i would take it for presicesly that reason,1434359394765
1,"only 20 kilmoetres to go, but any propvisions would be weclome over a couple of days and butter is pure energy",1434359421035
1,"ok then, agreed yes",1434359436356
1,thats true but i wonder if it would get wet?,1434359523570
1,although hadnt thought about it as insulation so probably is worth taking,1434359535900
1,it it gets wet you could just leave it,1434359543694
1,so you want to put yes?,1434359552010
1,an empty cigarette lightes doesnt seem useful!?!,1434359581800
1,so thats agreed no,1434359600893
1,no i agree cant see what it would be for,1434359644113
1,i was struggling to decide on the clothes as tey are heavy but good for warmth,1434359664711
1,wear them the whole time?,1434359703072
1,i guess so. and it said it would get very cold,1434359722447
1,at night,1434359724141
1,"ok, i think I put no the first time but lets put yes",1434359766969
1,the tarp is interesting as it is so large it would be heavy,1434359820894
1,yeah,1434359831005
1,i think it would be very dangerous not to take it if te nights were expected to be below freezing,1434359846676
1,and if it got tangled or was to heavy you can just leave it,1434359881812
1,theyve got to get 20 kms so its not that far even through forest,1434359896661
1,so lets take it,1434359900351
1,ok,1434359917286
1,the mao seems a must. there is no pilot int he group but air maps are very detiled so it would be useful,1434359942500
1,yep,1434360008808
1,so thats a yes then,1434360013899
1,ok good,1434360059628
1,im not sure we would need the whisky,1434360073193
1,maybe as an antiseptci but its a lot to carry,1434360104842
1,"it may do, lol",1434360113428
1,but someoe needs to stay awake in case a bear comes!,1434360122610
1,"ha, probably is in such a stressful situation",1434360172645
1,so thats a no,1434360176404
1,ok,1434360198211
1,if we are taking the map I guess we'll need the compass!,1434360208930
1,"yes, so agreed yes then",1434360226524
1,"and to finish, thereis no coneivable reason to leave chocolate behind!",1434360249923
1,a bear would eat it,1434360255050
1,true. ok so agreed on chocolate yes. shall we submit our anwsers? we arent supposed to review them i dont think,1434360327497
1,in case of emergency!,1434360341558
1,or just because there were some gun hapy folk on the plane,1434360357902
1,"ok, lets do that now",1434360384557
1,"ha, yes. ive never been in a small plane and its best if it's a rare occurrence",1434360444472
1,"yes, good to chat",1434360447682
1,back to unpacking for me. have a good day.,1434360484092
2,I think we have to agree.,1434622709335
2,Also I think I've accidentlayy filled in this bit before we talked about it.,1434622731117
2,"Okay, I was wondering whether it was best for them to go to the town or stay somewhere and keep warm. I think you can use the wire wool and the lighter to make a fire.",1434622778317
2,yep here is a link about it.,1434622883964
2,"<a href=""http://www.practicalsurvivor.com/firesteelwool"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.practicalsurvivor.com/firesteelwool"">http://www.practicalsu...lwool</a>",1434622887764
2,Well if they aren't going far then I guess they can take as much stuff as they like.,1434622909596
2,yep the axe def for getting wood,1434622924540
2,Yep.,1434622961032
2,Bears?,1434622969228
2,Yep to frighten bears.,1434623000659
2,I guess you can either eat the butter or smear it on yourself to keep warm.,1434623022211
2,Okay leave the butter,1434623048299
2,Newspapers good for starting fire and keeping warm,1434623065419
2,"sorry are messages crossed, should we leave the butter?",1434623102491
2,okay.,1434623128762
2,We ned the lighter though to light the steel wool,1434623142195
2,Okay,1434623167480
2,Lighter?,1434623173578
2,agreed,1434623190858
2,Extra cloths seem useful but providing they have shelter/fire and food maybe no essential. However if they aren't going far why not take them?,1434623249034
2,okay lets bring them.,1434623318890
2,Canvas def I think. They can make a tent with it.,1434623352034
2,Whisky probably a bad idea :-(,1434623371721
2,Sorry. Hmm the map. Well as they are just going to go somewhere near and stay put I suppose they don't need it.,1434623425825
2,"Hmm, I think your list might be in a different order to mine...",1434623498065
2,Compass is like tha map so without the map might as well leave the compass,1434623523058
2,Are you still there?,1434623553344
2,So shall we leave the compass?,1434623588248
2,At least they will no which direction they have gone in. Lets take it then.,1434623674152
2,"I think the chocolate is a good idea. Fire, sheleter, chocolate, doesn't sound so bad.",1434623750023
2,"Okay so thats us done. We ar eleaving butter, map and whiskey and taking everything else. Agreed?",1434623883286
2,"Hmm, well I'm especially glad given the expereince of the rescuers with bears and minus 40!",1434623945014
2,"Good, thanks. I will get on with the last bit then, bye.",1434623981030
3,Hi Graham. Are you good to go?,1435051665853
3,Okay. So we start with the discussing the ball of steel wool?,1435051888340
3,"I said ""no"", I couldn't think of an important use for it.",1435051937683
3,"Ah, I didn't know that.",1435052003258
3,"Given that the lighter has no fuel there doesn't seem to be any other way of lighting a fire, so I think the wool would be good to take.",1435052041330
3,OK,1435052063294
3,"I thought the Axe was a fairly clear yes. Good for cutting trees for shelter, firewood, rafts etc.",1435052106022
3,I also said yes to the gun. Canada has bears and coyotes and the like so would be necessary for protection. It could also be used to grab human attention with the noise.,1435052192659
3,"A bit dangerous, potentially, though.",1435052219251
3,True :-),1435052285422
3,I said no for the butter. I didn't think it was nutritious enough and would weigh quite a lot.,1435052320039
3,"Yeah, I wasn't sure if I should mention items further down the list, but I went with the chocolate instead as it has both sugar and fat and would probably be lighter. It's also more easily divvied out to multiple people?",1435052495491
3,"Ah, true.",1435052587981
3,"I said no to the newspapers. While they could be used for fires, the axe and plentiful trees should do the trick? They could also be used for cover/warmth, but I went with the extra clothes instead.",1435052653939
3,"They are light weight, o I suppose it wouldn't hurt to take them",1435052698753
3,"Agreed, let's go for yes.",1435052778573
3,"I said no to the lighter as it has no fuel, but do you think it's necessary to start fires with the steel wool?",1435052803549
3,I've seen people start fires with only wood and it might be possible in combination with the wool. That might be asking too much of untrained survivors.,1435052879515
3,So we'll say yes to the lighter,1435052900770
3,I also said yes for the extra clothes. Need to keep warm.,1435052921406
3,OK,1435053009589
3,I said no to the canvas. It would be good for cover but it would be too big and heavy.,1435053028622
3,Plus wood could be used to make a cover/structure using the axe.,1435053044199
3,"Yeah, that's what I thought.",1435053139075
3,I said yes for the air map. It might be confusing and have irrelevant information but it should have some ground details that would help navigation.,1435053194576
3,"I assumed ""air map"" meant one for pilots, but they seem to have hills and things on them which would be landmarks?",1435053223842
3,OK,1435053264549
3,"Fighting my Scottishness, I said no to the whisky. It dehydrates and causes people with guns to do bad things.",1435053307119
3,"I had considered it's use as a fire accelerant, but didn't think it would be useful enough.",1435053354712
3,OK,1435053391960
3,"A solid yes for the compass, necessary for navigation and easy to understand even for novices?",1435053419090
3,OK. And we already agreed on the chocolate instead of the butter?,1435053434837
3,Great. Although we've laden the poor people with most of the items ;-) hopefully there are some heavy lifters among them.,1435053475255
3,"I wonder if this might come back to haunt us. Like a choose your own adventure book, Yolanda will tell us we've killed them all by making them take too much stuff...",1435053513204
3,"Do we just hit ""submit your answers"" and leave it at that?",1435053554363
3,"Great. Thanks, have a good day.",1435053586704
