ok! lets get started. do we need the steel wool?,1434358879100
I think I put that we shouldnt take it as I cant think what survival uses it might have,1434358938876
its not for fire lighting and isnt help against the weather,1434358949162
shall we put no then?,1434358953997
ok,1434358973476
"so agreed no on that one, yes.",1434358990403
onto the axe,1434359002345
"yes, i think it would be necessary to get fire wood",1434359068204
and its only xmall so not too heavy,1434359073553
so agreed yes,1434359079324
ok good,1434359109572
now the pistol,1434359116902
i think it would be necessary to scare away any bears,1434359151680
there are a lot of bears in northern canada!,1434359171421
"and again, a pistol is nt that heavy.",1434359182257
shall we say yes?,1434359185155
i think i would feel we needed it on the chance we met a bear,1434359254405
otherwise how would we scare them off?,1434359263364
"ok then, thats a yes.",1434359327815
what were your thoughts on the butter?,1434359342766
i would take it for presicesly that reason,1434359394765
"only 20 kilmoetres to go, but any propvisions would be weclome over a couple of days and butter is pure energy",1434359421035
"ok then, agreed yes",1434359436356
thats true but i wonder if it would get wet?,1434359523570
although hadnt thought about it as insulation so probably is worth taking,1434359535900
it it gets wet you could just leave it,1434359543694
so you want to put yes?,1434359552010
an empty cigarette lightes doesnt seem useful!?!,1434359581800
so thats agreed no,1434359600893
no i agree cant see what it would be for,1434359644113
i was struggling to decide on the clothes as tey are heavy but good for warmth,1434359664711
wear them the whole time?,1434359703072
i guess so. and it said it would get very cold,1434359722447
at night,1434359724141
"ok, i think I put no the first time but lets put yes",1434359766969
the tarp is interesting as it is so large it would be heavy,1434359820894
yeah,1434359831005
i think it would be very dangerous not to take it if te nights were expected to be below freezing,1434359846676
and if it got tangled or was to heavy you can just leave it,1434359881812
theyve got to get 20 kms so its not that far even through forest,1434359896661
so lets take it,1434359900351
ok,1434359917286
the mao seems a must. there is no pilot int he group but air maps are very detiled so it would be useful,1434359942500
yep,1434360008808
so thats a yes then,1434360013899
ok good,1434360059628
im not sure we would need the whisky,1434360073193
maybe as an antiseptci but its a lot to carry,1434360104842
"it may do, lol",1434360113428
but someoe needs to stay awake in case a bear comes!,1434360122610
"ha, probably is in such a stressful situation",1434360172645
so thats a no,1434360176404
ok,1434360198211
if we are taking the map I guess we'll need the compass!,1434360208930
"yes, so agreed yes then",1434360226524
"and to finish, thereis no coneivable reason to leave chocolate behind!",1434360249923
a bear would eat it,1434360255050
true. ok so agreed on chocolate yes. shall we submit our anwsers? we arent supposed to review them i dont think,1434360327497
in case of emergency!,1434360341558
or just because there were some gun hapy folk on the plane,1434360357902
"ok, lets do that now",1434360384557
"ha, yes. ive never been in a small plane and its best if it's a rare occurrence",1434360444472
"yes, good to chat",1434360447682
back to unpacking for me. have a good day.,1434360484092
