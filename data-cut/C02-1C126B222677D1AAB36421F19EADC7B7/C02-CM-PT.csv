I think we have to agree.,1434622709335
Also I think I've accidentlayy filled in this bit before we talked about it.,1434622731117
"Okay, I was wondering whether it was best for them to go to the town or stay somewhere and keep warm. I think you can use the wire wool and the lighter to make a fire.",1434622778317
yep here is a link about it.,1434622883964

Well if they aren't going far then I guess they can take as much stuff as they like.,1434622909596
yep the axe def for getting wood,1434622924540
Yep.,1434622961032
Bears?,1434622969228
Yep to frighten bears.,1434623000659
I guess you can either eat the butter or smear it on yourself to keep warm.,1434623022211
Okay leave the butter,1434623048299
Newspapers good for starting fire and keeping warm,1434623065419
"sorry are messages crossed, should we leave the butter?",1434623102491
okay.,1434623128762
We ned the lighter though to light the steel wool,1434623142195
Okay,1434623167480
Lighter?,1434623173578
agreed,1434623190858
Extra cloths seem useful but providing they have shelter/fire and food maybe no essential. However if they aren't going far why not take them?,1434623249034
okay lets bring them.,1434623318890
Canvas def I think. They can make a tent with it.,1434623352034
Whisky probably a bad idea :-(,1434623371721
Sorry. Hmm the map. Well as they are just going to go somewhere near and stay put I suppose they don't need it.,1434623425825
"Hmm, I think your list might be in a different order to mine...",1434623498065
Compass is like tha map so without the map might as well leave the compass,1434623523058
Are you still there?,1434623553344
So shall we leave the compass?,1434623588248
At least they will no which direction they have gone in. Lets take it then.,1434623674152
"I think the chocolate is a good idea. Fire, sheleter, chocolate, doesn't sound so bad.",1434623750023
