Hi Graham. Are you good to go?,1435051665853
Okay. So we start with the discussing the ball of steel wool?,1435051888340
"I said ""no"", I couldn't think of an important use for it.",1435051937683
"Ah, I didn't know that.",1435052003258
"Given that the lighter has no fuel there doesn't seem to be any other way of lighting a fire, so I think the wool would be good to take.",1435052041330
OK,1435052063294
"I thought the Axe was a fairly clear yes. Good for cutting trees for shelter, firewood, rafts etc.",1435052106022
I also said yes to the gun. Canada has bears and coyotes and the like so would be necessary for protection. It could also be used to grab human attention with the noise.,1435052192659
"A bit dangerous, potentially, though.",1435052219251
True :-),1435052285422
I said no for the butter. I didn't think it was nutritious enough and would weigh quite a lot.,1435052320039
"Yeah, I wasn't sure if I should mention items further down the list, but I went with the chocolate instead as it has both sugar and fat and would probably be lighter. It's also more easily divvied out to multiple people?",1435052495491
"Ah, true.",1435052587981
"I said no to the newspapers. While they could be used for fires, the axe and plentiful trees should do the trick? They could also be used for cover/warmth, but I went with the extra clothes instead.",1435052653939
"They are light weight, o I suppose it wouldn't hurt to take them",1435052698753
"Agreed, let's go for yes.",1435052778573
"I said no to the lighter as it has no fuel, but do you think it's necessary to start fires with the steel wool?",1435052803549
I've seen people start fires with only wood and it might be possible in combination with the wool. That might be asking too much of untrained survivors.,1435052879515
So we'll say yes to the lighter,1435052900770
I also said yes for the extra clothes. Need to keep warm.,1435052921406
OK,1435053009589
I said no to the canvas. It would be good for cover but it would be too big and heavy.,1435053028622
Plus wood could be used to make a cover/structure using the axe.,1435053044199
"Yeah, that's what I thought.",1435053139075
I said yes for the air map. It might be confusing and have irrelevant information but it should have some ground details that would help navigation.,1435053194576
"I assumed ""air map"" meant one for pilots, but they seem to have hills and things on them which would be landmarks?",1435053223842
OK,1435053264549
"Fighting my Scottishness, I said no to the whisky. It dehydrates and causes people with guns to do bad things.",1435053307119
"I had considered it's use as a fire accelerant, but didn't think it would be useful enough.",1435053354712
OK,1435053391960
"A solid yes for the compass, necessary for navigation and easy to understand even for novices?",1435053419090
OK. And we already agreed on the chocolate instead of the butter?,1435053434837
Great. Although we've laden the poor people with most of the items ;-) hopefully there are some heavy lifters among them.,1435053475255
"I wonder if this might come back to haunt us. Like a choose your own adventure book, Yolanda will tell us we've killed them all by making them take too much stuff...",1435053513204
"Do we just hit ""submit your answers"" and leave it at that?",1435053554363
"Great. Thanks, have a good day.",1435053586704
