Yep,1435051750705
OK,1435051902848
Take it or leave it?,1435051918911
Apparently it's very good for lighting fires from a spark.  Might be useful if it's -40,1435051962447
So I said yes.,1435051978255
"Yes, it could be used with the lighter, even with no lighter fluid.",1435052023823
"OK, let's go for yes then.",1435052054495
"Agreed, let's go for yes.",1435052130030
"True, and you could also kill yourself if you don't want to freeze to death.  So yes to that.",1435052247566
:-),1435052251982
"I said yes, but only because it has some calories.  Walking 20miles would be tough with nothing to eat.",1435052417645
Maybe leave the butter and take the chocolate.,1435052434925
"Okay, let's leave the butter and take the chocolate.",1435052542428
"Also, there's no tin opener.",1435052554412
i said yes to the newspapers - handy for fires.,1435052655996
Lighting a fire without paper is a bit of a nightmare.  Good for bogroll too.,1435052717675
OK,1435052781355
I think we've agreed to take the lighter already,1435052804507
"Yes, you need a spark to light steel woo.",1435052821403
"Flints will do it, but you'd need to find them first.",1435052840555
OK,1435052905722
"Agreed, so yes to that one.",1435052938634
"I wasn't sure.  It's heavy to carry, though useful.  However, you could make a good bivouac with branches.",1435053070489
So let's say no to that one.,1435053081001
"I wasn't sure about the air map. What's the scale, etc. DOn;t know if it'd be useful",1435053196013
"And it's plastic, so it could be useful, so let's take it.",1435053251208
Indeed. It's also not good to drink alcohol in the low temperatures.  Best left behind.,1435053381400
Compass.  Definitely.,1435053409320
"Yes, let's take it.",1435053431448
OK.  We're done!,1435053441416
"Well they're mostly small, except for the canvas and that's been left behind.",1435053510423
"Oh well, they've got the gun :-)",1435053534759
Cheers,1435053544871
Done,1435053563079
