2,extra clothes good idea I think - could wear them.,1434359691988
2,"Wear rather than carry, I think as cold weather",1434359720991

5,"I thought the Axe was a fairly clear yes. Good for cutting trees for shelter, firewood, rafts etc.",1435052106022
5,I also said yes to the gun. Canada has bears and coyotes and the like so would be necessary for protection. It could also be used to grab human attention with the noise.,1435052192659

5,True :-),1435052285422

6,"True, and you could also kill yourself if you don't want to freeze to death.  So yes to that.",1435052247566
6,:-),1435052251982
6,"Agreed, so yes to that one.",1435052938634
6,Indeed. It's also not good to drink alcohol in the low temperatures.  Best left behind.,1435053381400
