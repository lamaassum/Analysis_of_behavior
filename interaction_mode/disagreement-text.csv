1,ok! lets get started. do we need the steel wool?,1434358879100
1,I think I put that we shouldnt take it as I cant think what survival uses it might have,1434358938876
1,its not for fire lighting and isnt help against the weather,1434358949162
1,shall we put no then?,1434358953997
1,ok,1434358973476
1,"so agreed no on that one, yes.",1434358990403
1,now the pistol,1434359116902
1,i think it would be necessary to scare away any bears,1434359151680
1,there are a lot of bears in northern canada!,1434359171421
1,"and again, a pistol is nt that heavy.",1434359182257
1,shall we say yes?,1434359185155
1,i think i would feel we needed it on the chance we met a bear,1434359254405
1,otherwise how would we scare them off?,1434359263364
1,"ok then, thats a yes.",1434359327815
1,what were your thoughts on the butter?,1434359342766
1,i would take it for presicesly that reason,1434359394765
1,"only 20 kilmoetres to go, but any propvisions would be weclome over a couple of days and butter is pure energy",1434359421035
1,"ok then, agreed yes",1434359436356
1,thats true but i wonder if it would get wet?,1434359523570
1,although hadnt thought about it as insulation so probably is worth taking,1434359535900
1,it it gets wet you could just leave it,1434359543694
1,so you want to put yes?,1434359552010
1,the tarp is interesting as it is so large it would be heavy,1434359820894
1,yeah,1434359831005
1,i think it would be very dangerous not to take it if te nights were expected to be below freezing,1434359846676
1,and if it got tangled or was to heavy you can just leave it,1434359881812
2,I can't recall what I said last time for this but not sure what we'd use it for...,1434358918481
2,So I think no unless you have a reason to take,1434358963238
2,Ok so we agree no?,1434358983058
2,agree no.,1434358999538
2,"I think this may be too dangerous, though may need to shoot a bear, given where we are!",1434359153889
2,Only if someone would be able to use it safely.,1434359215458
2,"Ok, we'll say yes.",1434359302073
2,Not sure what we could use butter for.  Unless it's for eating in this dire emergency?,1434359368275
2,"ok, yes then.  If it's so cold, it won't melt.",1434359423164
2,newspaper would be handy as fire lighting and extra layer if trying to keep warm.,1434359495134
2,yes!,1434359562504
2,"canvas useful as shelter, even if large and heavy to carry.",1434359823440
2,agreed.  must be some stronger people who could manage it.,1434359875673
2,"yes, think that's best.",1434359917217
3,"Okay, I was wondering whether it was best for them to go to the town or stay somewhere and keep warm. I think you can use the wire wool and the lighter to make a fire.",1434622778317
3,yep here is a link about it.,1434622883964
3,"<a href=""http://www.practicalsurvivor.com/firesteelwool"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.practicalsurvivor.com/firesteelwool"">http://www.practicalsu...lwool</a>",1434622887764
3,I guess you can either eat the butter or smear it on yourself to keep warm.,1434623022211
3,Okay leave the butter,1434623048299
3,Extra cloths seem useful but providing they have shelter/fire and food maybe no essential. However if they aren't going far why not take them?,1434623249034
3,okay lets bring them.,1434623318890
3,Whisky probably a bad idea :-(,1434623371721
4,OK Q1 - I think  NO,1434622731115
4,"that sounds good, agree",1434622857256
4,Q4 no butter,1434623022955
4,"never thought about using it to keep warm, so yes then",1434623047266
4,could be useful if they encounter wet weather,1434623308164
4,agreed,1434623331091
4,and the whisky,1434623476768
5,Okay. So we start with the discussing the ball of steel wool?,1435051888340
5,"I said ""no"", I couldn't think of an important use for it.",1435051937683
5,"Ah, I didn't know that.",1435052003258
5,"Given that the lighter has no fuel there doesn't seem to be any other way of lighting a fire, so I think the wool would be good to take.",1435052041330
5,OK,1435052063294
5,I said no for the butter. I didn't think it was nutritious enough and would weigh quite a lot.,1435052320039
5,"Yeah, I wasn't sure if I should mention items further down the list, but I went with the chocolate instead as it has both sugar and fat and would probably be lighter. It's also more easily divvied out to multiple people?",1435052495491
5,"Ah, true.",1435052587981
5,"I said no to the newspapers. While they could be used for fires, the axe and plentiful trees should do the trick? They could also be used for cover/warmth, but I went with the extra clothes instead.",1435052653939
5,"They are light weight, o I suppose it wouldn't hurt to take them",1435052698753
5,"Agreed, let's go for yes.",1435052778573
5,"I said no to the lighter as it has no fuel, but do you think it's necessary to start fires with the steel wool?",1435052803549
5,I've seen people start fires with only wood and it might be possible in combination with the wool. That might be asking too much of untrained survivors.,1435052879515
5,So we'll say yes to the lighter,1435052900770
5,I said no to the canvas. It would be good for cover but it would be too big and heavy.,1435053028622
5,Plus wood could be used to make a cover/structure using the axe.,1435053044199
5,"Yeah, that's what I thought.",1435053139075
5,I said yes for the air map. It might be confusing and have irrelevant information but it should have some ground details that would help navigation.,1435053194576
5,"I assumed ""air map"" meant one for pilots, but they seem to have hills and things on them which would be landmarks?",1435053223842
5,OK,1435053264549
6,OK,1435051902848
6,Take it or leave it?,1435051918911
6,Apparently it's very good for lighting fires from a spark.  Might be useful if it's -40,1435051962447
6,So I said yes.,1435051978255
6,"Yes, it could be used with the lighter, even with no lighter fluid.",1435052023823
6,"OK, let's go for yes then.",1435052054495
6,"I said yes, but only because it has some calories.  Walking 20miles would be tough with nothing to eat.",1435052417645
6,Maybe leave the butter and take the chocolate.,1435052434925
6,"Okay, let's leave the butter and take the chocolate.",1435052542428
6,"Also, there's no tin opener.",1435052554412
6,i said yes to the newspapers - handy for fires.,1435052655996
6,Lighting a fire without paper is a bit of a nightmare.  Good for bogroll too.,1435052717675
6,OK,1435052781355
6,I think we've agreed to take the lighter already,1435052804507
6,"Yes, you need a spark to light steel woo.",1435052821403
6,"Flints will do it, but you'd need to find them first.",1435052840555
6,OK,1435052905722
6,"I wasn't sure.  It's heavy to carry, though useful.  However, you could make a good bivouac with branches.",1435053070489
6,So let's say no to that one.,1435053081001
6,"I wasn't sure about the air map. What's the scale, etc. DOn;t know if it'd be useful",1435053196013
6,"And it's plastic, so it could be useful, so let's take it.",1435053251208
