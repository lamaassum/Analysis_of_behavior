1,I think we have to agree.,1434622709335
1,Also I think I've accidentlayy filled in this bit before we talked about it.,1434622731117
1,"Okay, I was wondering whether it was best for them to go to the town or stay somewhere and keep warm. I think you can use the wire wool and the lighter to make a fire.",1434622778317
1,yep here is a link about it.,1434622883964
1,"<a href=""http://www.practicalsurvivor.com/firesteelwool"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.practicalsurvivor.com/firesteelwool"">http://www.practicalsu...lwool</a>",1434622887764
1,Well if they aren't going far then I guess they can take as much stuff as they like.,1434622909596
1,yep the axe def for getting wood,1434622924540
1,Yep.,1434622961032
1,Bears?,1434622969228
1,Yep to frighten bears.,1434623000659
1,I guess you can either eat the butter or smear it on yourself to keep warm.,1434623022211
1,Okay leave the butter,1434623048299
1,Newspapers good for starting fire and keeping warm,1434623065419
1,"sorry are messages crossed, should we leave the butter?",1434623102491
1,okay.,1434623128762
1,We ned the lighter though to light the steel wool,1434623142195
1,Okay,1434623167480
1,Lighter?,1434623173578
1,agreed,1434623190858
1,Extra cloths seem useful but providing they have shelter/fire and food maybe no essential. However if they aren't going far why not take them?,1434623249034
1,okay lets bring them.,1434623318890
1,Canvas def I think. They can make a tent with it.,1434623352034
1,Whisky probably a bad idea :-(,1434623371721
1,Sorry. Hmm the map. Well as they are just going to go somewhere near and stay put I suppose they don't need it.,1434623425825
1,"Hmm, I think your list might be in a different order to mine...",1434623498065
1,Compass is like tha map so without the map might as well leave the compass,1434623523058
1,Are you still there?,1434623553344
1,So shall we leave the compass?,1434623588248
1,At least they will no which direction they have gone in. Lets take it then.,1434623674152
1,"I think the chocolate is a good idea. Fire, sheleter, chocolate, doesn't sound so bad.",1434623750023
1,"Okay so thats us done. We ar eleaving butter, map and whiskey and taking everything else. Agreed?",1434623883286
1,"Hmm, well I'm especially glad given the expereince of the rescuers with bears and minus 40!",1434623945014
1,"Good, thanks. I will get on with the last bit then, bye.",1434623981030
2,Hi Graham. Are you good to go?,1435051665853
2,Okay. So we start with the discussing the ball of steel wool?,1435051888340
2,"I said ""no"", I couldn't think of an important use for it.",1435051937683
2,"Ah, I didn't know that.",1435052003258
2,"Given that the lighter has no fuel there doesn't seem to be any other way of lighting a fire, so I think the wool would be good to take.",1435052041330
2,OK,1435052063294
2,"I thought the Axe was a fairly clear yes. Good for cutting trees for shelter, firewood, rafts etc.",1435052106022
2,I also said yes to the gun. Canada has bears and coyotes and the like so would be necessary for protection. It could also be used to grab human attention with the noise.,1435052192659
2,"A bit dangerous, potentially, though.",1435052219251
2,True :-),1435052285422
2,I said no for the butter. I didn't think it was nutritious enough and would weigh quite a lot.,1435052320039
2,"Yeah, I wasn't sure if I should mention items further down the list, but I went with the chocolate instead as it has both sugar and fat and would probably be lighter. It's also more easily divvied out to multiple people?",1435052495491
2,"Ah, true.",1435052587981
2,"I said no to the newspapers. While they could be used for fires, the axe and plentiful trees should do the trick? They could also be used for cover/warmth, but I went with the extra clothes instead.",1435052653939
2,"They are light weight, o I suppose it wouldn't hurt to take them",1435052698753
2,"Agreed, let's go for yes.",1435052778573
2,"I said no to the lighter as it has no fuel, but do you think it's necessary to start fires with the steel wool?",1435052803549
2,I've seen people start fires with only wood and it might be possible in combination with the wool. That might be asking too much of untrained survivors.,1435052879515
2,So we'll say yes to the lighter,1435052900770
2,I also said yes for the extra clothes. Need to keep warm.,1435052921406
2,OK,1435053009589
2,I said no to the canvas. It would be good for cover but it would be too big and heavy.,1435053028622
2,Plus wood could be used to make a cover/structure using the axe.,1435053044199
2,"Yeah, that's what I thought.",1435053139075
2,I said yes for the air map. It might be confusing and have irrelevant information but it should have some ground details that would help navigation.,1435053194576
2,"I assumed ""air map"" meant one for pilots, but they seem to have hills and things on them which would be landmarks?",1435053223842
2,OK,1435053264549
2,"Fighting my Scottishness, I said no to the whisky. It dehydrates and causes people with guns to do bad things.",1435053307119
2,"I had considered it's use as a fire accelerant, but didn't think it would be useful enough.",1435053354712
2,OK,1435053391960
2,"A solid yes for the compass, necessary for navigation and easy to understand even for novices?",1435053419090
2,OK. And we already agreed on the chocolate instead of the butter?,1435053434837
2,Great. Although we've laden the poor people with most of the items ;-) hopefully there are some heavy lifters among them.,1435053475255
2,"I wonder if this might come back to haunt us. Like a choose your own adventure book, Yolanda will tell us we've killed them all by making them take too much stuff...",1435053513204
2,"Do we just hit ""submit your answers"" and leave it at that?",1435053554363
2,"Great. Thanks, have a good day.",1435053586704
3,Yep,1435051750705
3,OK,1435051902848
3,Take it or leave it?,1435051918911
3,Apparently it's very good for lighting fires from a spark.  Might be useful if it's -40,1435051962447
3,So I said yes.,1435051978255
3,"Yes, it could be used with the lighter, even with no lighter fluid.",1435052023823
3,"OK, let's go for yes then.",1435052054495
3,"Agreed, let's go for yes.",1435052130030
3,"True, and you could also kill yourself if you don't want to freeze to death.  So yes to that.",1435052247566
3,:-),1435052251982
3,"I said yes, but only because it has some calories.  Walking 20miles would be tough with nothing to eat.",1435052417645
3,Maybe leave the butter and take the chocolate.,1435052434925
3,"Okay, let's leave the butter and take the chocolate.",1435052542428
3,"Also, there's no tin opener.",1435052554412
3,i said yes to the newspapers - handy for fires.,1435052655996
3,Lighting a fire without paper is a bit of a nightmare.  Good for bogroll too.,1435052717675
3,OK,1435052781355
3,I think we've agreed to take the lighter already,1435052804507
3,"Yes, you need a spark to light steel woo.",1435052821403
3,"Flints will do it, but you'd need to find them first.",1435052840555
3,OK,1435052905722
3,"Agreed, so yes to that one.",1435052938634
3,"I wasn't sure.  It's heavy to carry, though useful.  However, you could make a good bivouac with branches.",1435053070489
3,So let's say no to that one.,1435053081001
3,"I wasn't sure about the air map. What's the scale, etc. DOn;t know if it'd be useful",1435053196013
3,"And it's plastic, so it could be useful, so let's take it.",1435053251208
3,Indeed. It's also not good to drink alcohol in the low temperatures.  Best left behind.,1435053381400
3,Compass.  Definitely.,1435053409320
3,"Yes, let's take it.",1435053431448
3,OK.  We're done!,1435053441416
3,"Well they're mostly small, except for the canvas and that's been left behind.",1435053510423
3,"Oh well, they've got the gun :-)",1435053534759
3,Cheers,1435053544871
3,Done,1435053563079
