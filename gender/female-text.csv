1,ok! lets get started. do we need the steel wool?,1434358879100
1,I think I put that we shouldnt take it as I cant think what survival uses it might have,1434358938876
1,its not for fire lighting and isnt help against the weather,1434358949162
1,shall we put no then?,1434358953997
1,ok,1434358973476
1,"so agreed no on that one, yes.",1434358990403
1,onto the axe,1434359002345
1,"yes, i think it would be necessary to get fire wood",1434359068204
1,and its only xmall so not too heavy,1434359073553
1,so agreed yes,1434359079324
1,ok good,1434359109572
1,now the pistol,1434359116902
1,i think it would be necessary to scare away any bears,1434359151680
1,there are a lot of bears in northern canada!,1434359171421
1,"and again, a pistol is nt that heavy.",1434359182257
1,shall we say yes?,1434359185155
1,i think i would feel we needed it on the chance we met a bear,1434359254405
1,otherwise how would we scare them off?,1434359263364
1,"ok then, thats a yes.",1434359327815
1,what were your thoughts on the butter?,1434359342766
1,i would take it for presicesly that reason,1434359394765
1,"only 20 kilmoetres to go, but any propvisions would be weclome over a couple of days and butter is pure energy",1434359421035
1,"ok then, agreed yes",1434359436356
1,thats true but i wonder if it would get wet?,1434359523570
1,although hadnt thought about it as insulation so probably is worth taking,1434359535900
1,it it gets wet you could just leave it,1434359543694
1,so you want to put yes?,1434359552010
1,an empty cigarette lightes doesnt seem useful!?!,1434359581800
1,so thats agreed no,1434359600893
1,no i agree cant see what it would be for,1434359644113
1,i was struggling to decide on the clothes as tey are heavy but good for warmth,1434359664711
1,wear them the whole time?,1434359703072
1,i guess so. and it said it would get very cold,1434359722447
1,at night,1434359724141
1,"ok, i think I put no the first time but lets put yes",1434359766969
1,the tarp is interesting as it is so large it would be heavy,1434359820894
1,yeah,1434359831005
1,i think it would be very dangerous not to take it if te nights were expected to be below freezing,1434359846676
1,and if it got tangled or was to heavy you can just leave it,1434359881812
1,theyve got to get 20 kms so its not that far even through forest,1434359896661
1,so lets take it,1434359900351
1,ok,1434359917286
1,the mao seems a must. there is no pilot int he group but air maps are very detiled so it would be useful,1434359942500
1,yep,1434360008808
1,so thats a yes then,1434360013899
1,ok good,1434360059628
1,im not sure we would need the whisky,1434360073193
1,maybe as an antiseptci but its a lot to carry,1434360104842
1,"it may do, lol",1434360113428
1,but someoe needs to stay awake in case a bear comes!,1434360122610
1,"ha, probably is in such a stressful situation",1434360172645
1,so thats a no,1434360176404
1,ok,1434360198211
1,if we are taking the map I guess we'll need the compass!,1434360208930
1,"yes, so agreed yes then",1434360226524
1,"and to finish, thereis no coneivable reason to leave chocolate behind!",1434360249923
1,a bear would eat it,1434360255050
1,true. ok so agreed on chocolate yes. shall we submit our anwsers? we arent supposed to review them i dont think,1434360327497
1,in case of emergency!,1434360341558
1,or just because there were some gun hapy folk on the plane,1434360357902
1,"ok, lets do that now",1434360384557
1,"ha, yes. ive never been in a small plane and its best if it's a rare occurrence",1434360444472
1,"yes, good to chat",1434360447682
1,back to unpacking for me. have a good day.,1434360484092
2,I can't recall what I said last time for this but not sure what we'd use it for...,1434358918481
2,So I think no unless you have a reason to take,1434358963238
2,Ok so we agree no?,1434358983058
2,agree no.,1434358999538
2,"\i think yes for this, may be helpful for eg making shelter, fire wood...",1434359042040
2,"so yes, good",1434359103739
2,"I think this may be too dangerous, though may need to shoot a bear, given where we are!",1434359153889
2,Only if someone would be able to use it safely.,1434359215458
2,"Ok, we'll say yes.",1434359302073
2,Not sure what we could use butter for.  Unless it's for eating in this dire emergency?,1434359368275
2,"ok, yes then.  If it's so cold, it won't melt.",1434359423164
2,newspaper would be handy as fire lighting and extra layer if trying to keep warm.,1434359495134
2,yes!,1434359562504
2,couldn't think of a use for lighter without fluid...,1434359597235
2,some survival expert may know of a use but I think no here.,1434359633247
2,extra clothes good idea I think - could wear them.,1434359691988
2,"Wear rather than carry, I think as cold weather",1434359720991
2,I think they are definitely worth taking.,1434359756626
2,ok.,1434359785135
2,"canvas useful as shelter, even if large and heavy to carry.",1434359823440
2,agreed.  must be some stronger people who could manage it.,1434359875673
2,"yes, think that's best.",1434359917217
2,"map only a part, but may also help as shelter as plastic.",1434359979574
2,"sorry, just read sectional air map, rather than just a section.",1434360036594
2,"any way, agree useful so should take.",1434360054858
2,Whisky to anaesthetise everyone?,1434360103892
2,don't think it's needed!,1434360134891
2,dangerous to have whisky and a loaded gun!,1434360151586
2,agree no.,1434360193370
2,compass useful,1434360215531
2,"yes,  I agree",1434360227527
2,"chocolate full of calories, so useful",1434360271949
2,bear probably more keen to eat a human!,1434360287409
2,I'm now wondering why there was a loaded pistol on the flight...,1434360331800
2,I think we only need to ubmit them.,1434360376918
2,scary thought.  Glad this is only a theoretical exercise.,1434360418498
2,"ok, let's submit answers. Interesting chat!",1434360444557

3,"agree, it would also help boost sugar levels to keep them going",1434623826666
